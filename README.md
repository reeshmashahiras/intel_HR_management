## Problem Statement

In the field of HR, we encounter persistent challenges:

1. Manual operations impede adaptability to dynamic job requirements.
2. Lack of objective resume scoring and ranked ordering.
3. Addressing scheduling challenges and automating HR processes.

Our solution aims to revolutionize HR workflows by leveraging the power of Gen AI & LLM with Intel toolkits.

## Solution

Our solution harnesses the power of Gen AI and LLM with the Intel Developer Cloud to streamline HR workflows:

1. Leveraging LLM for Job Description Evaluation, optimizing HR processes by providing the required skills for the job.
2. Utilizing Intel Toolkits for CV Ranking, scoring resumes based on skills and sorting them accordingly.
3. Incorporating question generation with Gen AI to auto-generate interview questions for HR.
